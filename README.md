# Weather
An iOS project that will become a unique, aesthetically pleasing weather application. This is my, as well as Will's, first official iOS application project. We're excited to launch it on the app store by the end of the summer.

Check the issues and projects sections to see what we're currently working on.

Aiming for release date of August 20th.
